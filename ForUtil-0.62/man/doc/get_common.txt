BUGS
       If a bug occurs, it will most likely be generated  by  the
       MS-DOS versions of these tools. This will be mainly due to
       the 640kb memory limit MS-DOS has.

       If you think you have found a bug, you can send  email  to
       the  author, describing what the bug is, how you generated
       it and if you can reproduce it. Also specify the  platform
       where this bug occured.
