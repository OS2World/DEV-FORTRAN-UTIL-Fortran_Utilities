This is the OS/2 port of the Fortran Utilities, v.0.62, by Koen D'Hondt
(ripley@xs4all.nl).
These tools are quite useful for Fotran programmers, I was pointed to
them when I was looking for a utility that could generate a tags file
from Fortran sources for use with vi. ftags included here can do that,
it even handles fweb files (literate programming sources) rather well.

(For people using ffscan it may be worthwile to check out ftnchek by 
Robert Moniot which is more powerful.)


Location:
====================

This has been uploaded (or will be moved from the respective /incoming
areas) to:

 ftp://ftp-os2.cdrom.com/pub/os2/dev32/forut062.zip
 ftp://ftp-os2.nmsu.com/pub/os2/dev32/forut062.zip

You will also want to check the web site of the author
 http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/ForUtil.html
since he may well fold the changes in a new release.


Installation:
====================

You will need (these files can be found on the usual OS/2 ftp sites)

* emxrtl.zip: the EMX runtime library (emx09b, fixpak 5, or later),
  which should be installed. 

In the archive you have things like:

  -rwxrwxrwx    97369 Jan 23 00:17 exe/fflow.exe
  -rwxrwxrwx   109263 Jan 23 00:19 exe/ffscan.exe

Bugs and the like:
==================

Bugs clearly related to the OS/2 port to me (sad@utk.edu;
stefand@elphy.irz.hu-berlin.de), even though I can't promise I will be
able to fix them. After all this was just a re-compile, more or less.
Bugs clearly related to the Fortran Tools themselves better to Koen
D'Hondt (ripley@xs4all.nl). So.  Now have fun.
