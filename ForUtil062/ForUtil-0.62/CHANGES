Version 0.62
- more work on winfflow.
- updated scanner rules for fflow, winfflow and ffscan.
- updated scanner rules in scan_commons to pick up DOUBLE, COMPLEX.
- updated scan_commons so it will pick up all variable declarations inside
  fortran source files also.
- list_commons now reports the total number of variable declarations stored as 
  well as the total number of unique variable declarations also.
- corrected a bug in ffscan: single quotes are now treated correctly.
- added a license.txt for binary distributions.
- Second official release into the public domain.

Version 0.61 (never released)
- Added winfflow, a MS-Windows version of fflow.

Version 0.60
- fixed the scanner rules in scan_commons to also pick PARAMETER declarations
  in header files.
- fixed a bug with the -Eext option.
- fixed a bug in strend.
- finally fixed the MSDOS versions (problems were due to stack overflow. 
  The size of stack and heap can be set in lib/sysdeps.h).
  They should perform pretty okay now.
- added the -n and -ofile option to ffscan.
- added warning messages if the maximum number of the -I, -E and -x options
  are about to be exceeded.
- fixed a bug in the count_args routine in ffscan.l This bug was hidden under
  unix where the name part of a filename is a large number. Under msdos this
  length is 12, which gave problems with fortran routines that have names
  longer than that.
- put msdos pwd emulation functions in msdospwd.h and msdospwd.c.
- updated all documentation.
- updated Makefiles. They are a whee bit more gnu-like now.

Versions 0.54 to 0.59 (never released)
- A lot of work went into ffscan, a little program which performs a 
  argument count of subroutines. Especially the flex rules to pick up
  all possible combinations of arguments gave me a headache.
- changed configure so it does not give up with an error if it can't find 
  libgdbm.a or gdbm.h
- fixed a number of small bugs and added numerous enhancments in the code
- updated man pages
- added the --help and --version options to all tools except ftags.
- put all system dependencies into one single header file (sysdeps.h) as
  to minimize system specific #ifdef/#endif in general code.

Version 0.53
- intermediate release with a few bugfixes.
  unofficial public domain release.

Version 0.53
- First official release into the public domain.
