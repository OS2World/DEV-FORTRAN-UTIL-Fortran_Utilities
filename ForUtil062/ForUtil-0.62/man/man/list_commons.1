.SH NAME
list_commons \- list the contents of a f77 common database.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B list_commons [-shv] 
.BI \-d database
.BI \-f incfile
.BI \-o outfile

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B list_commons 
can be used to manually check the contents of a
common database. It outputs every common it finds in a given
database. 
.B list_commons
examines a database generated with 
.BR scan_commons (1).

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-h, \-\-help"
Shows a short description of every option.

.TP
.B "\-s"
If you use this flag, 
.B list_commons 
will sort the contents of
the database per file that has been stored in the database.
If this option is not given, 
.B list_commons 
will just list
the entire (unsorted) contents of the database. Using this 
option can take a while since the entire database has to be 
scanned entirely before the output can be sorted. The MS-DOS 
version might run out of memory if you have a large database.

.TP
.B "\-v"
Show database version information. This information consists 
of the name of the user that has created this database, the 
machine and system name where this database was created on, 
the date of the last update of this database, and the 
directories stored.

.TP
.B "\-\-version"
Shows the version number of get_common.

.TP
.BI \-d database
Name of the database to list. If no database is given, the 
value of 
.B COMMON_DATABASE 
is checked.

.TP
.BI \-f incfile
This is the same as the -s option, with the main difference being that
only the commons for 
.I incfile
will be shown.

.TP
.BI \-o outfile
Using this option will cause
.B list_commons
to store its output in the file
.I outfile.
If not given, 
.B list_commons
will write it's output to stdout.

.SH COMPATIBILITY
.B list_commons
has run under HP-UX 9 and 10, SGI IRIX 5.2 & 5.3, DEC OSF1, 
SunOs 4.1 and 4.3, Cray Unicos, IBM AIX 3.2 & 4.1, Linux and MSDOS 6.2. 
.B list_commons
also runs in a dos box under Windows 3.1, 3.11 and Win95.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B "COMMON_DATABASE"
Points to the location of a common database. This environment
variable is only used if no database is given on the command line.

.SH BUGS
If a bug occurs, it will most likely be generated by the MS-DOS
versions of these tools. This will be mainly due to the 640kb 
memory limit MS-DOS has.

If you think you have found a bug, you can send email to the author,
describing what the bug is, how you generated it and if you can
reproduce it. Also specify the platform where this bug occured.
