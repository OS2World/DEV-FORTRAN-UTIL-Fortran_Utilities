<H3>DESCRIPTION</H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> builds a database from the contents of common
       blocks or variable declarations.  <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> is intended
       to work with f77 include files  containing  common  blocks
       and  global  variable declarations, but can works with f77
       source files.

       The following variable declarations are recognized:  <STRONG>CHAR-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>ACTER,</STRONG>  <STRONG>COMMON,</STRONG>  <STRONG>COMPLEX,</STRONG> <STRONG>DOUBLE</STRONG> <STRONG>PRECISION,</STRONG> <STRONG>INTEGER,</STRONG> <STRONG>LOGI-</STRONG>
       <STRONG>CAL,</STRONG> <STRONG>PARAMETER</STRONG> and <STRONG>REAL.</STRONG>

       The generated database can  subsequently  be  used  for  a
       quick  lookup  using  <a href="get_common.html">get_common</a>(1)  to  see  in which f77
       include file a certain common variable is defined.

       <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> uses the GNU database manager gdbm for  stor-
       ing, checking and retrieving items in the database.



</PRE>
<H3>OPTIONS</H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>-a</STRONG>     Add  duplicate  commons if they are defined in dif-
              ferent include files. If you choose not to use this
              flag,  duplicate  commons  defined in different f77
              include files will not be stored in  the  generated
              database.


       <STRONG>-f</STRONG>     Store  filenames only. The default is to store path
              and  filename.   Use  this   option   to   preserve
              diskspace  (or  memory if you are running this tool
              under MS-DOS).


       <STRONG>-h,</STRONG> <STRONG>--help</STRONG>
              gives a short overview of every option.


       <STRONG>-q</STRONG>     be really quiet. This will only print fatal  errors
              on stderr.  Usefull if called from a script.


       <STRONG>-r</STRONG>     re-organize  the  database after creation/updating.
              This may take a long time since  the  old  database
              will be read, sorted and written again. This option
              can be used standalone.

       <STRONG>-s</STRONG>     safe operation: every time a common  is  found  the
              database  will  be  updated  immediatly. Using this
              option can slow  the  generation  or  update  of  a
              database seriously down since no caching will done.


       <STRONG>-v</STRONG>     Be verbose.  <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> will print out a list  of
              directories  to visit, what extensions it is using,
              the number of files it has to scan, a complete list
              of  all  files to scan and a status report of every
              file scanned.  The output of these statistics is as
              follows:

              Statistics for file foo.inc (9/67)
              commons found      : 16
                     The total number of commons found in foo.inc
              duplicate commons  : 3
                     The total number of duplicate commons  found
                     in foo.inc. These duplicates can be found in
                     another include file.
              commons rejected   : 0
                     Number of commons rejected. This number  can
                     be different from 0 if you are performing an
                     update of a database.
              commons accepted   : 19
                     Total number of commons accepted  for  stor-
                     age.
              commons stored     : 19
                     Total number of commons actually stored.


       <STRONG>--version</STRONG>
              Shows the version number of <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG>


       <STRONG>-E</STRONG><EM>ext</EM>  Extensions <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> must use to determine which
              files it has to scan. Up to eight -E  are  allowed.
              Use  <EM>-E-</EM>  to  specify  no  extension.   The default
              extension is the empty extension.


       <STRONG>-I</STRONG><EM>dir</EM>  Using this option tells <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> which directo-
              ries it has to search for f77 files containing com-
              mon blocks. Only the contents of that directory are
              scanned.  Subdirectories  are ignored.  Up to 64 -I
              are allowed.


       <STRONG>-d</STRONG><EM>database</EM>
              Name of the database to create  or  update.  If  no
              database  is  specified,  <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> looks at the
              value of the environment  variable  <STRONG>COMMON_DATABASE</STRONG>
              If   this  variable  points  to  a  database,  that
              database will be used.

       <STRONG>-x</STRONG><EM>name</EM> Tells <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> to exclude the named  file  when
              scanning the files found with the <EM>-I</EM> <EM>-E</EM> options. Up
              to 64 -x are allowed.


       <STRONG>[files]</STRONG>
              Additional files to scan for common blocks

<H3>DIAGNOSTICS</H3><PRE>
       The following warning messages can occur:

       <STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> <STRONG>intended</STRONG> <STRONG>comment</STRONG> <STRONG>found</STRONG>
              scan_commons has detected a comment (a line  begin-
              ning  with a *, c or C) which does not start at the
              beginning of a line but before the seventh  column.

       <STRONG>Warning:</STRONG> <STRONG>more</STRONG> <STRONG>than</STRONG> <STRONG>19</STRONG> <STRONG>continuation</STRONG> <STRONG>lines</STRONG> <STRONG>near</STRONG> <STRONG>line</STRONG> <STRONG>XX</STRONG>
              scan_commons  has  detected more than 19 successive
              continuation lines. XX  indicates  near  what  line
              this occurs.

       <STRONG>Parse</STRONG> <STRONG>Error:</STRONG> <STRONG>unbalanced</STRONG> <STRONG>brace</STRONG> <STRONG>or</STRONG> <STRONG>delimiter</STRONG>
              a  unbalanced brace or delimiter has been detected.
              When this happens, <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> will tell you  near
              what  line  this error occured. This is a non-fatal
              error.

       <STRONG>Internal</STRONG> <STRONG>Parse</STRONG> <STRONG>Error:</STRONG> <STRONG>Invalid</STRONG> <STRONG>token</STRONG> <STRONG>range</STRONG>

       <STRONG>Internal</STRONG> <STRONG>Parse</STRONG> <STRONG>Error:</STRONG> <STRONG>Failed</STRONG> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <STRONG>remove</STRONG> <STRONG>common</STRONG> <STRONG>keywords</STRONG>
              These are internal parser errors, which  will  most
              likely  never be generated.  If these occur, please
              contact the author. These errors are fatal.

<H3>COMPATIBILITY</H3><PRE>
       The generated database can be shared without  problems  on
       different 32bit systems, but you can not access a database
       generated on a 32bit system from a 16 or 64 bit system.

       The MS-DOS versions have been built  with  flex  2.53  (no
       changes to the source code) and gdbm 1.7.3, which required
       some work to get it working under MS-DOS.

       <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> has run under HP-UX 9 and 10, SGI IRIX 5.2  &amp;
       5.3, DEC OSF1, SunOs 4.1 and 4.3, Cray Unicos, IBM AIX 3.2
       &amp; 4.1, Linux and MSDOS 6.2.  <STRONG>scan_commons</STRONG> also runs  in  a
       dos box under Windows 3.1, 3.11 and Win95.



</PRE>
<H3>ENVIRONMENT</H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>COMMON_DATABASE</STRONG>
              Points  to  the location of a common database. This
              environment variable is only used if the <STRONG>-d</STRONG><EM>database</EM>
              option is not given.

</PRE>
<H3>BUGS</H3><PRE>
       A known bug is a malloc  failure  when  updating  a  large
       database  under  MS-DOS.   This is a gdbm-related failure,
       and the only  solution  is  to  create  several,  smaller,
       databases.

       If  a  bug occurs, it will most likely be generated by the
       MS-DOS versions of these tools. This will be mainly due to
       the 640kb memory limit MS-DOS has.

       If  you  think you have found a bug, you can send email to
       the author, describing what the bug is, how you  generated
       it  and if you can reproduce it. Also specify the platform
       where this bug occured.
