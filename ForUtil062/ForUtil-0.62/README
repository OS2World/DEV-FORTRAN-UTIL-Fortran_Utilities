Compilation & Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

1. Type configure at the top-level directory. 

   The file INSTALL contains information on how to run configure.

   By default, install will place binaries and manual pages in
   /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/man/[man,cat]1. If you want them in
   another directory, you can tell configure what directory make install
   should use by running configure with the --prefix=PATH option. 

   If configure can't find libgdbm.a, it will give you a warning saying
   just that. The consequence to this is that you will not be able to
   compile the common utilities. If you do want to build them, you need
   to get and compile gdbm. You can get gdbm from a large number of ftp
   sites around the world. Compiling gdbm is simple, just follow the 
   instructions that come with it.

2. Check the top-level makefile and, if necessary, set appropriate values
   for CCFLAGS, LDFLAGS, INCLUDES and LOADLIBES

   For HPUX, you do need to set -Aa (for ansi compatibility) as well as
   -D_HPUX_SOURCE and -D_POSIX_SOURCE.
   If the compilation fails, most of the time it has something to do with
   adding the proper defines, such as -D_POSIX_SOURCE.

   By default, CFLAGS is set to -g. You might want to use -O or -O2 instead
   since the performance loss by using -g is quite considerable.

   If you only want to build a certain part of the source tree, say you
   only want to build ffscan and fflow, you can do this by changing the
   SUBDIRS line in the toplevel makefile until it reads:
     SUBDIRS= lib fflow ffscan

   Never remove ``lib'' from this line.

3. Type make at the top-level directory to build everything.

4. Type make install to install the binaries

5. Install the manual pages. You have two options here:
   make install.cat will install preformatted manual pages in man/cat1
   make install.man will install the raw groff manual pages in man/man1

   Alternatively, you can type
       make install.all
   which will install the binaries, groff source manpages and formatted 
   man pages.

6. Type make clean or remove the entire source tree.


Other things to mention
-----------------------

gdbm:
   If you have build gdbm and you have set INCLUDES to point to the
   path where you have build libgdbm, be _sure_ to remove or rename 
   the autoconf.h file in the gdbm directory. 
   If you do not do this, make will get confused and will not know what 
   autoconf.h it must use when compiling ForUtil.


Man pages:
   ForUtil comes with four different types of manual pages, all of them 
   are in the man/ directory:

   - doc; contains plain text versions of the manual pages
   - html; contains html versions of the manual pages
   - man; contains the groff source for the manual pages
   - preformat; contains formatted manual pages.

   MSDOS users might want to get a copy of less for MSDOS, which is capable 
   of showing formatted unix manual pages.


flex:
   If you do not have flex, do not touch any of the .l files.
   Make will try to create .c files out of these and fail because you do
   not have flex.

If you are completely and utterly unable to compile these programs, contact
me and I will try to get you a binary.
