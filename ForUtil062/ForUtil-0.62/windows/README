usefull. See the file COPYING for more details.

Sources are in forutil/lib, forutil/windows/src and forutil/windows/lib. 
Everything is pure c, nothing fancy MFC or OWL or other stuff. The scanner 
(windows/src/winfflow.l) is written in flex and converted to c using a modified
version of the flex 2.5.2 skeleton. This version of flex is also available 
from our Web site (http://www.xs4all.nl/~ripley/RSD/GnuPorts.html)

To compile winfflow, your project must include the following directories:
forutil\lib : general utilities. Compile as a static lib for MS-Windows exe.
	Add all .c files _except_ alloca.c
forutil\windows\lib : general window utilities. Compile as above.
	Add all .c files
forutil\windows\src : winfflow source. Link with above two libraries.
	Add all .c files. Don't add winfflow.l to the project.

To compile the sources properly, you must define HAVE_CONFIG_H.
You also need to add the following directories to the include path of your
compiler: 
	forutil
	forutil\lib
	forutil\windows\lib

In addition, you will need to link in ctl3dv2.lib _and_ bwcc.lib

The sources for winfflow.hlp are in windows/hlp. Both the .doc and .rtf file
are there, as well as a file winfflow.lst which contains the names of all
hotspots. The file winfflow.doc also contains three macros that I use to add
and create hotspots jumps and popups. If you think you can use them, feel free 
to do so. 

IMPORTANT:
if you do NOT have a version of flex (or don't know what that is) for use 
under msdos, do not remove src/lexyy.c

The sources for the modified poppad are _not_ included. Contact us if you 
want to get them.
